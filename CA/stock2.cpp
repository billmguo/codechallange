Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most two transactions.

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

我们其实可以求至少k次交易的最大利润。我们定义local[i][j]为在到达第i天时最多可进行j次交易并且最后一次交易在最后一天卖出的最大利润，
此为局部最优。然后我们定义global[i][j]为在到达第i天时最多可进行j次交易的最大利润，此为全局最优。它们的递推式为：

local[i][j] = max(global[i - 1][j - 1] + max(diff, 0), local[i - 1][j] + diff)

global[i][j] = max(local[i][j], global[i - 1][j])，
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int> &prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        int n = prices.size(), g[n][3] = {0}, l[n][3] = {0};
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            int diff = prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            for (int j = 1; j <= 2; ++j) {
                l[i][j] = max(g[i - 1][j - 1] + max(diff, 0), l[i - 1][j] + diff);
                g[i][j] = max(l[i][j], g[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }
        return g[n - 1][2];
    }
};

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)


buy[i]  = max(rest[i-1] - price, buy[i-1]) 
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1])
rest[i] = max(sell[i-1], buy[i-1], rest[i-1])


rest[i] = sell[i-1]

buy[i]  = max(sell[i-2] - price, buy[i-1]) 
sell[i] = max(buy[i-1] + price, sell[i-1])


class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy = INT_MIN, pre_buy = 0, sell = 0, pre_sell = 0;
        for (int price : prices) {
            pre_buy = buy;
            buy = max(pre_sell - price, pre_buy);
            pre_sell = sell;
            sell = max(pre_buy + price, pre_sell);
        }
        return sell;
    }
};

[LeetCode] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee 买股票的最佳时间含交易费
 

Your are given an array of integers prices, for which the i-th element is the
 price of a given stock on day i; and a non-negative integer fee representing a transaction fee.

sold[i] = max(sold[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee);

hold[i] = max(hold[i - 1], sold[i - 1] - prices[i]);

class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        vector<int> sold(prices.size(), 0), hold = sold;
        hold[0] = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); ++i) {
            sold[i] = max(sold[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee);
            hold[i] = max(hold[i - 1], sold[i - 1] - prices[i]);
        }
        return sold.back();
    }
};
