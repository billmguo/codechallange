So I consider this problem in a different way:
dp[M][K]means that, given K eggs and M moves,
what is the maximum number of floor that we can check.

The dp equation is:
dp[m][k] = dp[m - 1][k - 1] + dp[m - 1][k] + 1,
which means we take 1 move to a floor,
if egg breaks, then we can check dp[m - 1][k - 1] floors.
if egg doesn't breaks, then we can check dp[m - 1][k - 1] floors.

dp[m][k] is similar to the number of combinations and it increase exponentially to N

Time Complexity:
For time, O(NK) decalre the space, O(KlogN) running,
For space, O(NK).

C++:

    int superEggDrop(int K, int N) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(N + 1, vector<int>(K + 1, 0));
        int m = 0;
        while (dp[m][K] < N) {
            m++;
            for (int k = 1; k <= K; ++k)
                dp[m][k] = dp[m - 1][k - 1] + dp[m - 1][k] + 1;
        }
        return m;
    }
